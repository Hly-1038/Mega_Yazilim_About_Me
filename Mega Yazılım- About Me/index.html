    <p class="text-center mt-3">Hello, I'm HÃ¼lya!</p>
    <p>I graduated from the Computer Engineering Department of Konya Food and Agriculture University in 2023. I successfully completed a one-year English preparatory program and earned the right to continue to the faculty section. Additionally, all of my university courses were conducted in English, allowing me to enhance my English proficiency academically. Currently, I am employed as a System and Network Engineer at Konya Metropolitan Municipality.</p>
    </br>
    <p>One day, I came across the application announcement for the Mega Software Program on social media. I applied and was fortunate enough to be selected among 300 valuable participants out of 1800 applicants. Through this training, I gained access to high-quality educational opportunities and expanded my professional network.</p>
